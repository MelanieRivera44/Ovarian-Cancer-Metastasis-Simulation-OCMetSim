OCMetSim-Single cells is an agent-based model used to make predictions about ovarian cancer single cell metastasis to distant metastatic sites based on Rac1 GTPase expression.
OCMetSim-Spheroids is an agent-based model used to make predictions about ovarian cancer spheroid metastasis to distant metastatic sites based on Rac1 GTPase expression.

Adhesion and invasion parameters of ovarian cancer cells are set based on Rac1 overexpression or knockdown.
